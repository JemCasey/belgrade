Ross Gorman improvised the music that begins this work as a gag, but the composer liked it enough to keep it. Commissioned by Paul Whiteman for a concert called “An Experiment in Modern Music,” it opens with the aforementioned glissando for clarinet that many classical soloists have trouble performing. There are two orchestrations by Ferde Grofé, a later one for a full orchestra and an original for a jazz band. FTP, name this work that melds jazz and classical styles, a popular piano concerto by George Gershwin.
