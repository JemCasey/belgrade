		h2 Transparency
		p

			| just as how analytics gives website owners insight into user experience.
			br
			| If you use an ad blocker or anti-tracker that blocks Google Analytics, please consider turning it off for this website. 
			| I rely on interaction data to improve it.

		p
			| If you would like to hack on it, ask me for the database (SQLite).
